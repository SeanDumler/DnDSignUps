        I welcome you to join us on a fantastic story of marvelous wonder,
        nail-biting action, and wholesome fun! I want to introduce you
        to...Dungeons and Dragons!!!
      </p>

      <p>
        Now I know what you're thinking...I am just your average joe, with a 9-5
        job. How can I be a tall tale hero who saves a city? How can I be a
        stealthy, world renowned thief aiming to steal the most precious jewels?
        The answer is simple, IMAGINATION! Here, check out this video below by
        TheDungeoncast who explains what D&D is, how to play, and why you should
        start playing!

        See? It isn't as overwhelming as you would think! There are thousands,
        if not millions of players around the world playing Dungeons and
        Dragons. I myself play in 3 different campaigns with 3 different stories
        and 3 different characters. Trust me when I say, we all have a blast
        playing! Here are some reasons why I think you should give it a try:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>It's a chance to explore your imagination</li>
        <li>Explore a new fantasy world that you get to decide how you play</li>
        <li>
          Make new friends who have the same appreciation and love of adventure
          and excitement
        </li>
        <li>
          Have fun gaining new gear, leveling up, fighting monsters and bosses,
          developing a story
        </li>
        <li>Dice and minis! Oh and more dice! Did I mention dice?</li>
      </ul>
